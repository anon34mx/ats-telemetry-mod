This is a mod from the software made by FunBit
https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server
I added the database storage to save the telemetry data, so drivers can be evaluated at my workplace, also added the function to receive text from serial, in my case arduino and convert it to keyboards event, so we can have physical buttons.

More info about the driving simulator SMOVI in the manual [spanish]
